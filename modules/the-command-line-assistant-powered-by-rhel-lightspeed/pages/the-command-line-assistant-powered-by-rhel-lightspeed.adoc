=== The Command-Line Assistant Powered by RHEL Lightspeed

The command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed is an optional AI tool integrated into the RHEL command-line interface. It leverages generative AI, specifically the WatsonX AI API LLM, to provide expert assistance for RHEL systems.

Key capabilities include:

*   Answering RHEL-related questions.
*   Assisting with troubleshooting and fixing issues.
*   Helping understand log files.
*   Providing recommendations for configurations and tasks.
*   Supporting interactive workflows for system management.

It draws knowledge from Red Hat's KCS articles, RHEL documentation, and other official Red Hat resources.

FIXME: Consider adding a screenshot or short GIF demonstrating an interaction with the command-line assistant.
FIXME: A short video tutorial showcasing a practical exercise using the assistant to solve a common RHEL issue would greatly enhance understanding.
