#  Practical exercises for answering questions, troubleshooting, and more

== Hands-on Lab: Interacting with the Command-Line Assistant

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to effectively interact with the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed. This lab is designed to help you understand how to ask questions, troubleshoot issues, and leverage the assistant for various tasks.

### Setting up and using the command-line assistant

Before you begin, ensure that the command-line assistant is installed and provisioned to your RHEL deployments as described in Chapters 2 and 3.

To start using the command-line assistant, simply type `c` followed by your question in quotation marks. For example:

```
$ c "What is the status of the sshd service?"
```

The assistant will process your request and provide a relevant response based on the information available.

### Practical Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Answering RHEL-related questions

Ask the assistant various questions to get comfortable with its capabilities. Here are some examples:

1. `c "What is the default shell for the root user in RHEL?"`
2. `c "How do I check the version of my RHEL installation?"`
3. `c "What is the purpose of the yum command in RHEL?"`

#### Exercise 2: Troubleshooting issues

Use the command-line assistant to troubleshoot common RHEL issues. Refer to Chapter 5 for examples and syntax.

1. **Troubleshooting SSHD service failing to start**

   Use the `-w 1` option to include the output from the last command that was run. For example:

   ```
   $ c -w 1 "help me understand the error when failing to start sshd service"
   ```

   Then, run the suggested `journalctl -xeu sshd.service` command and pipe the output to the assistant for further analysis.

2. **Troubleshooting SELinux issues**

   Ask the assistant for guidance on resolving SELinux-related problems. For example:

   ```
   $ c "I am experiencing issues with SELinux. Can you provide a list of things to troubleshoot?"
   ```

#### Exercise 3: Leveraging additional features

Explore other functionalities offered by the command-line assistant, such as attaching files, checking history, redirecting command output, and submitting feedback
