== Hands-on Lab: Setting up a Simple Ansible Environment

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to set up a simple Ansible environment. This includes installing Ansible on your local machine or a virtual machine, configuring the inventory, and ensuring that your Ansible environment is ready for managing hosts.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following:

1. A system (local or virtual) with a supported operating system (like Ubuntu, CentOS, or macOS).
2. Basic command-line proficiency using tools like Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).
3. An understanding of SSH and basic network concepts.

### Step 1: Install Ansible

Begin by installing Ansible on your system. The installation process varies slightly depending on your operating system. Here are the steps for some common systems:

**For Ubuntu/Debian:**

1. Update the package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install Ansible:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ansible
   ```

**For CentOS/RHEL:**

1. Enable the EPEL repository:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install epel-release
   ```
2. Install Ansible:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install ansible
   ```

**For macOS (using Homebrew):**

1. Install Ansible:
   ```bash
   brew install ansible
   ```

Verify the installation by checking the Ansible version:

```bash
ansible --version
```

You should see the installed Ansible version printed in the terminal.

### Step 2: Configure Inventory

Ansible uses an inventory file to define the hosts it manages. Create an inventory file named `inventory.ini` in a new directory, e.g., `ansible-env`. Here's a basic example of what this file might look like:

```ini
[webservers]
web1.example.com ansible_host=192.168.1.100
web2.example.com ansible_host=192.168.1.101

[databases]
db1.example.com ansible_host=192.168.1.102

[all:vars]
ansible_user=your_username
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/
