== Basic Playbook Examples

Ansible playbooks are written in the YAML format and serve as the instruction set for Ansible to configure systems. They define the desired state of the managed nodes and instruct Ansible on how to achieve this state. This section will provide basic playbook examples to illustrate their structure and syntax.

### Playbook Structure and Syntax

A playbook consists of plays, which are lists of tasks that are executed on a set of hosts. Here's a basic playbook structure:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook Name
  hosts: Target Hosts
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Task Description
      ansible.builtin.command: Command to Execute
```

- `name`: A descriptive title for the playbook.
- `hosts`: The group of hosts targeted by the play.
- `become`: Whether to become a different user (usually 'root') for the tasks.
- `tasks`: A list of tasks to be executed on the target hosts.

### Basic Playbook Examples

#### Example 1: Installing Apache on Target Hosts

This playbook installs the Apache web server on a group of hosts called 'webservers'.

```yaml
---
- name: Install and start Apache
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Apache is installed
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present

    - name: Ensure Apache is running
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
```

#### Example 2: Managing Files

This playbook copies a local file to remote servers and ensures its presence.

```yaml
---
- name: Copy and manage a file
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Copy file from local to remote
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: /etc/ansible/myfile.conf
        dest: /etc/apache2/conf-available/myfile.conf

    - name: Ensure file permissions are set
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /etc/apache2/conf-available/myfile.conf
        mode: '0644'
```
