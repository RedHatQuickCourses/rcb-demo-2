#  Writing Ansible Playbooks


- **Playbook Structure and Syntax**: Ansible playbooks are written in YAML format, defining the desired state of a system. They consist of a list of plays, each specifying a target hosts and actions to be executed.
- **Basic Playbook Examples**: A simple playbook might include tasks like installing a package, copying a file, or managing services. For instance, a playbook to install Apache on a target host would include a task to ensure the 'apache2' package is installed.
- **Variables, Templates, and Include Statements**: Playbooks can use variables for dynamic configuration, templates for generating text files, and include statements to reuse code. This promotes modularity and reusability in playbooks.
