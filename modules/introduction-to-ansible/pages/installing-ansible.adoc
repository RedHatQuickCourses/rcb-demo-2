== Installing Ansible

Ansible can be installed on various platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. This section will guide you through the installation process on a Linux system, which is a common choice for Ansible due to its compatibility with SSH, the underlying protocol Ansible uses for communication.

### Prerequisites

Before installing Ansible, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- A 64-bit distribution of Linux (such as CentOS, Ubuntu, or Fedora)
- Python 2.7 or 3.5+ (Ansible 2.9 and later versions require Python 3)
- User with sudo or root privileges

### Installation on Red Hat-based Systems (e.g., CentOS, Fedora)

1. Update the system's package repository:

   [source, terminal]
   ----
   sudo yum update -y
   ----

2. Install Ansible using the package manager:

   [source, terminal]
   ----
   sudo yum install ansible -y
   ----

3. Verify the installation by checking the Ansible version:

   [source, terminal]
   ----
   ansible --version
   ----

### Installation on Debian-based Systems (e.g., Ubuntu)

1. Update the system's package repository:

   [source, terminal]
   ----
   sudo apt update -y
   ----

2. Install Ansible using the package manager:

   [source, terminal]
   ----
   sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
   sudo apt add-apt-repository --yes universe
   sudo apt install ansible -y
   ----

3. Verify the installation by checking the Ansible version:

   [source, terminal]
   ----
   ansible --version
   ----

### Installation on macOS

For macOS users, it is recommended to use a Linux virtual machine or a package manager like Homebrew:

1. If using Homebrew, first install it:

   [source, terminal]
   ----
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ----

2. Then, install Ansible:

   [source, terminal]
   ----
   brew install ansible
   ----

3. Verify the installation by checking the Ansible version:

   [source, terminal]
   ----
   ansible --version
   ----

After completing these steps, you should have Ansible successfully installed on your system. The
