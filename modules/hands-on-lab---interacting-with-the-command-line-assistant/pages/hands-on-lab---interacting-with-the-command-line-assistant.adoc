=== Hands-on Lab - Interacting with the Command-Line Assistant

This lab provides practical experience with the RHEL Lightspeed command-line assistant.

*   Learn to set up a test environment for the assistant.
*   Engage in practical exercises to leverage the assistant for various RHEL tasks, including:
    ** Asking RHEL-related questions using the `c` command (e.g., `c "What is RHEL"`).
    ** Attaching files to questions.
    ** Reviewing interaction history.
    ** Redirecting command output to the assistant.
    ** Enabling the assistant to capture terminal activity.
    ** Submitting feedback on responses.
    ** Troubleshooting common system issues, such as SSHD service failures or SELinux problems.

FIXME: Add screenshots or short video clips demonstrating the setup of the test environment.
FIXME: Include screenshots of various command-line assistant interactions, such as asking questions, attaching files, and troubleshooting.
FIXME: Consider a short video walkthrough for complex troubleshooting scenarios like debugging SSHD or SELinux issues.
